DEPLOYMENT
===========

In short, you run sc-build.

However.

Please note that, if your version of sc-build creates manifests, you should either:

- REALLY REALLY test that app with the manifest. Why? 
  Because I've had some problems with them. The content sometimes does not load
  when in standalone app mode on iPad, for instance.
  
  You may have to add it as a specific resource; it is in
  resources/guide/touch.json, so you'd basically copy the sample_image.jpg
  line in the manifest and change "sample_image" to "guide/touch.json"
  
- Do not use the manifest.
